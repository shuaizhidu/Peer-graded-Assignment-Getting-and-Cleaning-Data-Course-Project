# CodeBook

This code book describes the variables in `tidyData.txt`.

- `SubjectNo`: The ID of the test subject (1â€“30).
- `Activity`: The activity performed (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
- Remaining variables: The average of each mean and standard deviation measurement, grouped by subject and activity.

Variable names are descriptive, expanded from the original dataset:
- `Time` prefix = time domain signal
- `Frequency` prefix = frequency domain signal
- `Accelerometer` = accelerometer data
- `Gyroscope` = gyroscope data
- `Magnitude` = magnitude of the signals
