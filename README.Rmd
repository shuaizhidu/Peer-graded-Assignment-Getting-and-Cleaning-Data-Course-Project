# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repo contains the R script and documentation for the Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* final project.

## Files

- `run_analysis.R`: Script that downloads, cleans, and processes the UCI HAR Dataset into a tidy dataset.
- `tidyData.txt`: Output tidy dataset (created by `run_analysis.R`).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure you have R installed with the `data.table` and `reshape2` packages.
3. Place the UCI HAR dataset in your working directory (or let the script download it).
4. Run `source("run_analysis.R")`.
5. The tidy dataset will be written to `tidyData.txt` in your working directory.
